title: Julia Syntax
---

::: questions
- How do I write elementary programs in Julia?
- What are the differences with Python/Matlab/R?
:::

::: objectives
- functions
- loops
- conditionals
- containers: arrays, dictionary, set
- primitive types
- strings (inc interpolation)
- scoping (and do syntax?)
:::

::: keypoints
- Julia has `if-else`, `for`, `while`, `function` and `module` blocks that are not dissimilar from other languages.
- Blocks are all ended with `end`.
- ...
- Julia variables are not visible outside the block in which they're defined (unlike Python).
