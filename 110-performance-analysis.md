title: Performance Analysis
---

::: questions
- How can I measure the efficiency of my code?
- How can I identify bottle necks?
:::

::: objectives
- Learn how to use `BenchmarkTools`
- Learn how to use `Profiler` and `PProf`
:::

---

::: keypoints
- When you want to compare performance of different implementations, use `BenchmarkTools`.
- When you want to identify bottle necks, use `Profiler`.
- Pay close attention to the memory allocations.
