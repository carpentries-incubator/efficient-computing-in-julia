title: Types
---

::: questions
- How does Julia deal with types?
- Can I do Object Oriented Programming?
- People keep talking about multiple dispatch. What makes it so special?
:::

::: objectives
- dispatch
- structs
- abstract types
- parametric types
:::

::: keypoints
- Julia is fundamentally a dynamically typed language.
- Static types are only ever used for dispatch.
- Multiple dispatch is the most important means of abstraction in Julia.
- Parametric types are important to achieve type stability.
