title: Plotting
---

::: questions
- How do I quickly visualize some data?
- What is the best plotting package?
- Why is this taking so long, I thought Julia was fast?
:::

::: objectives
- Plots.jl
- Makie.jl
:::

::: keypoints
- `Plots.jl` is in some ways the 'standard' plotting package, but it is in fact quite horrible.
- `Makie.jl` offers a nice interface, pretty plots, is generally stable and very efficient once things have been compiled.
